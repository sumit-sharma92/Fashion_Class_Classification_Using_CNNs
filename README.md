# Fashion_Class_Classification_Using_CNNs
In this case study, we try to create a prototype version of how a virtual style assistant classifies fashion items(shirt, trouser, bag, sandal etc.) in images to make personal recommendations.
We are using the fashion MNIST data which is a dataset that contains ~70k grayscale images of bags, shoes and dresses.
As the output, we ask the deep network to classify the images into 10 classes.

Basically, we are trying to build a model that can look at images and tell us exactly what category of fashion is in it for eg. is it shorts,or a bag, or a dress or.. so on
SO, it will be an AI based deep learning model that can classify images to different categories or classes.

Objective - once we classify that a customer loves dresses, we can do target marketing to that specific customer.
A prime example of this kind of model is the amazon echo look style assisstant
